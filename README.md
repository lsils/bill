bill is a header-only reasoning library.  The library serves as an integration layer for various reasoning engines (such as decision diagrams or satisfiability solvers) and provides unified interfaces for them.

## Example

The following code snippet uses a SAT solver to prove De Morgan's law for propositional logic.

```c++
#include <bill/sat/solver.hpp>
#include <bill/sat/tseytin.hpp>

solver<solvers::ghack> solver;
auto const a = lit_type(solver.add_variable(), lit_type::polarities::positive);
auto const b = lit_type(solver.add_variable(), lit_type::polarities::positive);

auto const t0 = add_tseytin_and(solver, a, b);
auto const t1 = ~add_tseytin_or(solver, ~a, ~b);
auto const t2 = add_tseytin_xor(solver, t0, t1);
solver.add_clause(t2);

CHECK(solver.solve() == result::states::unsatisfiable);
```

## EPFL logic sythesis libraries

bill is part of the [EPFL logic synthesis](https://lsi.epfl.ch/page-138455-en.html) libraries.  The other libraries and several examples on how to use and integrate the libraries can be found in the [logic synthesis tool showcase](https://github.com/lsils/lstools-showcase).
